## About NOC (version 0.0.0)
**About:**
NOC calculates and overrides your Outlook's default browser-styles so that your calendar appointments have a more _intuitive_ look. You still have 100% full access to opening & editing all of your old/canceled calendar meetings, they'll just look slightly more opaque.  

**What to do:**  
  Simply download this [extenstion]() and enjoy!  

**Features:**
 - _Expired meetings_ appear opaque.
 - _Canceled appointments_ have a new color, opaque-grey.
 - The current day of th week (in _WorkWeek_, _Week_ and _Month_ views) is more apparent (the day is encased in an Outlook-red border).

**How:**
